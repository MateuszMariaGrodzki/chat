# Contributing

## Development branches

This repo is using two development branches

- `APP_DEV` for client-side app development
- `BACKEND_DEV` for server development

## Git flow

We use git flow with feature/bug branches merged to development branches. Therefore, pull requests are supposed to be submitted with one of development branches as a target branch.

## Branches naming convention

We use branch naming convention with group tokens as prefix. Please apply to these while contributing. The prefixes used are as following:

|   Prefix    |        Content         |          Example           |
| :---------: | :--------------------: | :------------------------: |
|   `feat/`   |      New feature       | `feat/json-serialization`  |
|   `bug/`    | Fixing an existing bug | `bug/register-redirection` |
| `hotfix/`\* |      Hot fixes to      | `hotfix/user-profile-page` |

_\*We are not using `hotfix/` prefix until we start application versioning_
